        <li style="color:Gold;"> <h1>Â THE GREATNESS OF INFINATY WAR</h1> </li> 
      <p><strong> <li style="color:Red;"> Infinity War is one of the best movies to date, 
As soon as the movie starts you get amazing action. The action in my opinion is the
best part of the movie, this paired with all of the different characters with different
abilities and fighting styles makes it a really amazing visual  sight. Most of the big 
fights in Infinity War have amazing soundtracks, some with suspense, some are 
just to make the fight even better. Either way, all of the soundtracks are amazing!
But the thing that keeps both of these aspects together is the storytelling, the 
villain of this movie makes everything better! The story is simple but complex, easy
but hard to understand.</strong></p>
